# Weather Forecasting with Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to perform weather forecasting using machine learning algorithms and compares various frameworks for classification.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries:**
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `plotly`: For creating interactive visualizations.
  - `scikit-learn`: For implementing machine learning algorithms, including `KMeans` clustering.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize machine learning techniques to predict weather patterns and trends based on historical data. The approach includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Implementation of KMeans clustering for classification
- Interactive visualizations to analyze the results

## Getting Started
